                                        Created a small project similar to an endless runner. The objects are activated and deactivated every time the chunk is brought to the initial position. The player has to avoid the red cubes, collect coins and optionally can heal with the green spheres. The game becomes more difficult over time as the speed of the chunks gets faster and faster. The game has a saving system which allows for upgrades for the player like more life, a one use shield and others.                                   </p>

                                        A prototype for a procedural object placer. It takes a plane which can be resized. Depending on the available area, the manager will set a maximum number of objects it can spawn. This can be tweaked for lower values. The objects will afterwards be placed in such a way that none will overlap. The maximum amount of objects at the time in the scene allowed by the editor manager is 2000 spawned units, though, through code you can spawn up to 11000 units with little to now delay. The placer can spawn AIs, interactable objects and obstalces.
